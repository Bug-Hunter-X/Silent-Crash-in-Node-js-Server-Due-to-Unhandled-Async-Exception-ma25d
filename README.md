This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Node.js applications: silent crashes due to unhandled exceptions within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases a server that may crash without any clear indication to the user.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) provides a robust approach to handling such exceptions, preventing crashes and providing informative error responses.
